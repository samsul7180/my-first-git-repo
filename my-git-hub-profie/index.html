        In addition to prompts and writing advice, Vol. 8 includes an added accountability angle. It can be hard to commit to a regular writing practice, but we’re here to help! Using Google Classroom, participants will turn in one page of writing per week and will receive an email from us acknowledging that they have completed their writing for that week.
